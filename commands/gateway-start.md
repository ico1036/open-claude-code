description: Start the OpenClaudeCode messaging gateway daemon
---

Start the OpenClaudeCode gateway daemon to enable multi-channel messaging.

Use the `gateway_start` tool to start the daemon. If it's already running, check its status with `gateway_status`.

The gateway manages connections to messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord) and persists messages in a local SQLite database.
